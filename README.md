Cinematic Journey
=================

I have recently renewed my interest in cinema. As such I am going through the
Criterion collection and watching Mark Cousins’ _The Story of Film: An Odyssey_,
as well as a number of alternative sources for cinematic history.

As such, I am watching a lot of movies. The best way to absorb them is to review
them. Thus, this repo.

The file `journal.md` is just that, a cinematic journal. Each review is a new
markdown file beginning with the date in `YYYYMMDD_<title>.md` format. I will
use English titles with underscore spaces for the filenames and the original
language’s titles for the title within the file, as well as a translation (for
reference, especially in cases where the original title is in Cyrillic or
Japanese). The journal is a hodgepodge.
